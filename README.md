## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Pylint** | Checked for code style violations and coding standards. |
| **Flake8** | Verified PEP8 compliance and detected formatting issues. |
| **Bandit** | Scanned for potential security vulnerabilities. |


## üß© Issues Fixed (Highlights)

1. **Replaced bare `except:`** with explicit exception handling (`except (TypeError, ValueError)`).
2. **Removed use of `eval()`** to eliminate code injection risk.
3. **Fixed mutable default argument** (`logs=[]` ‚Üí `logs=None`).
4. **Used `with open()` context managers** for safer file operations.
5. **Added input validation** for functions accepting user input.
6. **Improved naming conventions** and added docstrings for clarity.
